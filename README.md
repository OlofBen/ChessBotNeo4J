# Chess bot made for Neo4j's chess bot competition at Teknikfokus 2024
I am proud to announce that I won Neo4j's chess bot competition at Teknikfokus 2024 with this bot.

  The bot is written by me (Olof Bengtsson) and 
  it uses the alpha-beta pruning algorithm to search for the best move
  Other features:
  - Killer moves
  - Static evaluation
  - Transposition table
  - Endgame detection
  - Move ordering
  - Extensions
  - Time management (ish)
